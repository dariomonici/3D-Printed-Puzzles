# H Puzzle - 🟥 (Level 10)

## 📄 Description

The H Puzzle is a classic two-piece entanglement puzzle, known for its deceptive simplicity. It consists of two identical or mirrored pieces, shaped somewhat like the letter 'H' with rounded or complex interlocks.

Its notorious **Level 10** rating comes not from the number of moves, but from the required movement being completely counter-intuitive to the puzzle's visible geometry. It forces the solver to discard all preconceived notions of how simple pieces should interact.

## 📜 Rules

1.  **Objective:** Completely separate the two interlocking pieces.
2.  **Movement:** You may only use manipulation (sliding, rotating, tilting). No excessive force, bending, or tools are allowed.
3.  **Goal:** Reassembly is optional, but often just as difficult as the initial separation!

### Step 1: Identify the Constraint
Hold the puzzle so the interlocking central bar is horizontal. Notice that sliding horizontally or vertically seems blocked by the piece geometry.

### Step 2: The Key Move (Rotation)
Instead of trying to slide the pieces flatly, you must **tilt one piece away from the other** slightly on the Z-axis (upward/downward) while simultaneously rotating it around the central axis.

### Step 3: Finding the Gap
There is a specific, tiny clearance angle that is only accessible when the pieces are rotated/tilted correctly. The pieces must be brought almost parallel again, but only after this crucial rotation has happened, allowing the small notch to pass the blockage point.

### Step 4: Separation
Once you find the "sweet spot" of tilt and rotation, the pieces will slide apart instantly. Remember this combination for reassembly!

> **Note:** The most common mistake is attempting to solve this purely by sliding (X/Y movement). The solution requires a careful 3D manipulation that seems impossible until the exact alignment is found.
