## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi, I'm **darionji**! 👋
I am an **Engineer and Maker, trying to turn CAD files into slightly unpredictable reality.**
I love designing mechanisms that challenge the mind and push the limits of what a standard 3D printer can do.

## 📊 Difficulty Legend

I use the widely recognized **1-10 puzzle rating scale** (similar to Puzzle Master) to categorize my designs, with corresponding colors:

* 🟩 **Level 5/6 - Easy/Tricky:** Quick, fun, and straightforward. Requires some basic spatial awareness.
* 🟦 **Level 7 - Challenging:** Requires focused thought and strategy.
* 🟨 **Level 8 - Demanding:** Requires advanced logical deduction and persistence.
* 🟧 **Level 9 - Gruelling:** A true brain-bender that will take significant time.
* 🟥 **Level 10 - Mind Boggling:** For expert solvers only. Often involves a hidden "trick" or counter-intuitive move.
